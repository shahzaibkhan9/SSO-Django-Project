**Project Contribution: Okta Replication**

In this project, I significantly contributed to replicating the functionality of the <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta system</a>. 

**Key Features:**
1. **Material UI Integration:** Tailoring the user interface to our specific needs, I seamlessly integrated the Material UI Template (Bootstrap) into our system, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
   
2. **Django Backend Development:** Leveraging Django's robust framework, I spearheaded the development of the backend, compartmentalizing each component into separate Django apps. This approach enhanced scalability and maintainability, crucial for a complex application like ours.

3. **Dynamic Application Assignment:** Implementing a dynamic feature, I enabled the assignment of specific applications to individual users based on their unique requirements. This personalized approach streamlined user workflows and optimized productivity within our organization.

**Rationale for Django Usage:**
We opted for Django due to the intricate nature of our application. Recognizing the need for modularity and organization, our team unanimously decided on Django to facilitate the development process. By structuring each component as a separate Django app, we ensured clarity, efficiency, and ease of management throughout the project lifecycle.

**Note:** While our project was initially intended for internal use within our organization, its development was halted per the request of our project lead.

# SSO-Django-Project

In response to the increasing demand for streamlined user authentication and enhanced security, we present a groundbreaking project that aims to develop a custom Single Sign-On (SSO) solution using Django and OAuth 2.0. Our project envisions creating a robust SSO platform that empowers users to access multiple applications with a unified set of credentials. Inspired by the success of identity management platforms like Okta, our initiative seeks to provide an open-source alternative that enhances user experience, elevates security measures, and simplifies user access across diverse applications.

## ScopeÂ 

The scope of this project is to design, develop, and implement a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution similar to Okta, using the Python programming language and the Django web framework for the backend. The frontend will be built using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This encompasses the creation and management of SSO credentials for employees, within the organization. This involves establishing a secure authentication mechanism, enabling users to generate SSO credentials using their company-provided email addresses. Furthermore, as part of this project, a comprehensive user lifecycle management system will be implemented. This will ensure that in the event of an employee's departure from the organization, a systematic process will be in place to promptly revoke all SSO access and privileges associated with their account.
